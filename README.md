- 🧠 IDE autocompletion for all dynamic keys
- ⚙️ Customizable via `vite.config.ts` (output path, prefix, key format)

## 🔍 Query Key Used Generator & Viewer

Tools for visualizing and tracking how your `queryKeys` are used across the project.

### 🛠 Query Key Used Generator

A companion Vite plugin that statically analyzes your code and tracks where `globalQueryKeys` are used.

- 🧾 Outputs usage metadata in `query-key-used-info.ts`
- 🔄 Useful for dead query detection and usage audits
- 💡 Works well with `Query Key Generator`
- ⚠️ Make sure to **exclude the other plugin’s output file** using `ignoreFiles` to avoid circular scans

> 📄 See usage: `./packages/query-key-used-generator/README.md`

A React UI component that displays the usage info generated by the plugin — great for debugging and understanding query dependencies.

- 📊 View where query keys are used in your app
- 🧹 Helps with cleaning up unused keys
- ⚙️ Plug-and-play component, toggleable in dev tools
- 🔌 Requires data from `query-key-used-info.ts`
